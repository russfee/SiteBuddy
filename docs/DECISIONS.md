# Decisions

- 2026-01-31: Chose Node.js over Python/Go. Rationale: Good ecosystem for web scraping (axios, cheerio) and markdown conversion (turndown), familiar to most developers.
- 2026-01-31: CLI over web UI. Rationale: Simpler to start, can be wrapped in web UI later if needed.
- 2026-01-31: Added website-content-migration Claude skill. Rationale: Provides structured workflow for content migration use cases, complements the core scraping functionality with content planning and rewriting capabilities.
