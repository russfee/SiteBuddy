# Read This First

You are working in a repo that follows a standard on-ramp. Start by reading:
- docs/SESSION_CONTEXT.md
- docs/COMMANDS.md
- docs/DECISIONS.md (if present)

Keep the reply concise. Ask only if something blocks progress.

## Bootstrap Interview (for new projects)
If docs are empty or missing, ask only the minimum questions needed to fill:
- One-sentence project description.
- Current goal for this session.
- 3–5 key files/folders to look at first.
- Known issues/risks.
- How to validate changes.

## Session Wrap (required)
Before ending the session, update:
- docs/SESSION_CONTEXT.md with changes made, current status, and next steps.
- docs/DECISIONS.md if any notable decisions were made.
